					<description><![CDATA[The final step into modding the game: replace the files on the console!]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>Welcome to the final part of my series of post focused on the modding of a <em>PS4 </em>game!</p>



<p>Since we&#8217;re approaching the end, allow me to rant a bit about a detail that would&#8217;ve saved me a fair amount of time if I knew about it beforehand.</p>



<p>As I already noticed in <a href="https://twitter.com/SakiMeguro/status/1342147956343005186" data-type="URL" data-id="https://twitter.com/SakiMeguro/status/1342147956343005186">2020</a>, <em>PS4 </em>games are encrypted inside .<em>PKG </em>files even once they are installed, and the only way to decrypt them is by booting the game up on the console. </p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><img decoding="async" width="833" height="126" src="https://sakimotor.github.io/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/EqBEVFFXAAA0vib.png" alt="" class="wp-image-69" srcset="https://sakimotor.github.io/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/EqBEVFFXAAA0vib.png 833w, https://sakimotor.github.io/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/EqBEVFFXAAA0vib-300x45.png 300w, https://sakimotor.github.io/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/EqBEVFFXAAA0vib-768x116.png 768w" sizes="(max-width: 833px) 100vw, 833px" /><figcaption class="wp-element-caption"><em>The game&#8217;s folder on the PS4, as seen by connecting through FTP. The whole game is encrypted and gets decrypted only on runtime.</em></figcaption></figure>



<p>As such, one would think that, in order to mod a <em>PS4 </em>game, we would need to repack the whole <em>Fake PKG </em>and reinstall it each time we modify a file. That&#8217;s what I did for my first dozen of tries, and the process was <strong><em>TEDIOUS</em></strong>! Imagine doing the whole process of <a href="https://sakimotor.github.io/2023/01/26/modding-the-silver-case-ps4-part-1-dumping-reinstalling/" data-type="post" data-id="23">Part 1</a> each time a mere file was modified, the waste of time was absolute between the <em>PKG </em>repacking (about 30 minutes), the transfer to USB (5-10 minutes), the actual installation (10 minutes) and finally booting the game up: a whole hour of <strong><em>NOTHING</em></strong>, urgh. </p>



<p>I thought I could finally seek salvation after finding out about <a href="https://www.psxhax.com/threads/ps4-patch-builder-for-building-modded-update-pkgs-by-modded-warfare.7112/page-11" data-type="URL" data-id="https://www.psxhax.com/threads/ps4-patch-builder-for-building-modded-update-pkgs-by-modded-warfare.7112/page-11">PS4 Patch Builder</a> but nope, it was the same, perhaps even worse. In order to use the program I needed a <strong>backup </strong>of the whole game as a <em>PKG</em> and an <em>Image0</em> folder with all my <strong>modded files</strong>, and, for some reason, the program didn&#8217;t function if said folder didn&#8217;t also have all the other files, which means that I know had the equivalent of two backups occupying my space for nothing! After hitting that <em>Build Package</em> button it would take around half an hour to generate the &#8220;Update&#8221; <em>PKG</em> so really there wasn&#8217;t much benefit to using that method, if not to generate a <em>slightly</em> tinier <em>PKG </em>than before, at the expense of having 3 copies of the game lying on my Hard Drive with no benefits.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><img decoding="async" width="901" height="521" src="https://sakimotor.github.io/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/FXdPyzVXgAMq_t4.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-70" srcset="https://sakimotor.github.io/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/FXdPyzVXgAMq_t4.jpg 901w, https://sakimotor.github.io/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/FXdPyzVXgAMq_t4-300x173.jpg 300w, https://sakimotor.github.io/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/FXdPyzVXgAMq_t4-768x444.jpg 768w" sizes="(max-width: 901px) 100vw, 901px" /><figcaption class="wp-element-caption"><em>A screenshot of the program, provided by its creator, <strong>MODDED WARFARE.</strong></em></figcaption></figure>



<p></p>



<p>Now that this is out of my way, allow me to introduce you to the actual way of modding a <em>PS4</em> game, the Holy Grail of modding, a technique similar to the Switch&#8217;s <em><a href="https://yuzu-emu.org/help/feature/game-modding/" data-type="URL" data-id="https://yuzu-emu.org/help/feature/game-modding/">LayeredFS</a></em> file replacement: <em><strong><a href="https://www.psxhax.com/threads/ps4-frame4-afr-application-file-redirector-tutorial-by-deathrgh.13356/" data-type="URL" data-id="https://www.psxhax.com/threads/ps4-frame4-afr-application-file-redirector-tutorial-by-deathrgh.13356/">AFR</a></strong></em> (<em>Application File Redirector)</em>! I will speak exclusively about <em><strong>GoldHEN</strong></em>&#8216;s implementation of it (as a <em>plugin)</em>, but it was originally made by  <strong><em>theorywrong</em></strong> for the <em><a href="https://github.com/OpenOrbis/mira-project" data-type="URL" data-id="https://github.com/OpenOrbis/mira-project">Mira Project</a></em>.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img decoding="async" width="1024" height="573" src="https://sakimotor.github.io/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/ps4-goldhen-v23-avec-ps4-homebrew-enabler-game-patches-et-afr-plugins-1024x573.png" alt="" class="wp-image-72" srcset="https://sakimotor.github.io/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/ps4-goldhen-v23-avec-ps4-homebrew-enabler-game-patches-et-afr-plugins-1024x573.png 1024w, https://sakimotor.github.io/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/ps4-goldhen-v23-avec-ps4-homebrew-enabler-game-patches-et-afr-plugins-300x168.png 300w, https://sakimotor.github.io/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/ps4-goldhen-v23-avec-ps4-homebrew-enabler-game-patches-et-afr-plugins-768x430.png 768w, https://sakimotor.github.io/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/ps4-goldhen-v23-avec-ps4-homebrew-enabler-game-patches-et-afr-plugins.png 1425w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /><figcaption class="wp-element-caption"><em>GoldHEN&#8217;s plugins usage guide.</em></figcaption></figure>



<p></p>



<p>As its name indicates, while the game is running, <em>AFR </em>replaces the games files with the ones we&#8217;ve put in a custom folder, eliminating all needs from repacking the <em>PKG</em> each time we want to edit a file. This method <strong>works with disc copies and legit PKGs</strong>!</p>



<p>The first thing we need to do is to download the<em> GoldHEN plugins</em> from the <strong><em><a href="https://github.com/GoldHEN/GoldHEN_Plugins_Repository" data-type="URL" data-id="https://github.com/GoldHEN/GoldHEN_Plugins_Repository">GitHub</a></em></strong> repository. Once downloaded, we need to edit the <strong><em>plugins.ini</em> </strong>file to enable the <em>plugins </em>we are going to use, and to tell which games we are going to load the <em>plugins</em> for. As I want to apply the <em>plugins</em> to any game, the file would look like this: </p>



<div class="hcb_wrap"><pre class="prism line-numbers lang-plain"><code>; Note: lines starting with semicolon are for comments.
; Load plugins for any title.

[default]
; Load the AFR plugin 
/data/GoldHEN/plugins/afr.prx

; Load plugins only for Playroom.

[CUSA00001]
/data/GoldHEN/plugins/afr.prx
/data/GoldHEN/plugins/no_share_watermark.prx</code></pre></div>



<p></p>



<p>With the  .ini file modified, it&#8217;s time to put the <em>plugins.ini</em> file and the <em>plugins </em>folder in your<em> PS4</em>, into the <em><code><strong>/data/GoldHEN/plugins/</strong></code>  </em>folder (we can do that by USB or by FTP).</p>



<p>Now, we can run <em>GoldHEN</em> and enable the plugins in the <em>Settings &gt; Debug Settings &gt; Plugins &gt; Enable Plugins Loader </em> section.</p>


<div class="wp-block-image">
<figure class="aligncenter size-full"><img decoding="async" width="655" height="367" src="https://sakimotor.github.io/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/image-4.png" alt="" class="wp-image-75" srcset="https://sakimotor.github.io/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/image-4.png 655w, https://sakimotor.github.io/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/image-4-300x168.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 655px) 100vw, 655px" /><figcaption class="wp-element-caption"><em>Enabling the Plugins Loader.</em></figcaption></figure></div>


<p></p>



<p>For each game we want to modify, we simply need to create a folder bearing the game&#8217;s <em><strong>TitleID</strong></em> inside of <em><code><strong>/data/GoldHEN/plugins/AFR</strong></code></em>, and place all of our modified files here.</p>



<p>If everything was done correctly, we  will see the difference each time we boot up the games with <em>AFR </em>enabled.</p>

<p></p>



<p>There are a few ways of distributing our modded data to the public, each with their pros and cons:</p>



<ul>
<li>The most <em><strong>user-friendly</strong></em> way would be by <strong>repackaging the whole game</strong> and <strong>uploading the PKG</strong> on the internet: anyone with a jailbroken console could install it, but it&#8217;s not only expensive in terms of space usage (we upload the whole game), but also obviously clearly illegal (<em>we upload the whole game</em>). I would not recommend using that as an option, especially if you want your mod project to be publicly available.</li>
</ul>



<ul>
<li>Another way would be by <strong>generating a custom update<em> </em></strong>so we would only need to distribute the files that we modified through a <em>Fake PKG</em>. Unfortunately, this method requires the user to dump their game and reinstall it as a <em>Fake PKG</em>, which isn&#8217;t optimal.</li>
</ul>



<ul>
<li>The best <em><strong>compromise between legality and ease of use</strong></em> would be the <strong>AFR </strong>we mentionted before: we only need to distribute the edited files, which the user can then copy to their console in the <em><code><strong>/data/GoldHEN/plugins/AFR/CUSAXXXX</strong></code></em>folder. </li>
</ul>



<ul>
<li>Even <em><strong>better </strong></em>legally, by using <em>Delta Patching</em> tools, such as <strong><em><a href="https://www.romhacking.net/utilities/598/">xdelta </a></em></strong>or <strong><em><a href="https://github.com/Moodkiller/xdelta3-gui-2.0" data-type="URL" data-id="https://github.com/Moodkiller/xdelta3-gui-2.0">xdelta3</a></em></strong>, instead of distributing the files directly, you can distribute patches that will <strong>modify the original files</strong> with the new data, which means the user would have to own their own dump, and that we don&#8217;t technically upload any (usable as a standalone) illegal content. </li>
</ul>



<ul>
<li>Another advantage is is that by only distributing the patched part of a file, we can drastically reduce the size of the patch we are going to share! Be warned though, this method requires the user to apply the patches <strong>by themselves</strong> before obtaining the modded file, and that an xdelta patch (to my knowledge) is applied to a <strong>single file</strong>, which, in case of a patch that modifies a lot of files,would make us generate the patches <strong>one by one</strong>, and the user would also need to apply them<strong> one by one</strong>!  (<em><strong>these cons could be solved by making Bash/Powershell/Python&#8230; scripts that handle the patching for the user, as xdelta handles CLI with no problem.)</strong></em></li>
</ul>



<p></p>

<p></p>



<p>And thus, our long guide finally comes to an end. Now, we are able to jailbreak a ps4 console, dump any game we want, modify its contents (<em>we covered the case of a Unity game)</em> and run the patched contents on the console as easily as possible. Thank you for reading this blog, I will come back for more <em>Sony</em>-oriented romhacking articles soon!</p>

					<description><![CDATA[In this post, I will explain how to work with the (not so) niche and proprietary .PSARC archive format, as well as the (even less) niche and proprietary Unity .assets archive format.]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>Our <a href="https://sakimotor.github.io/2023/01/26/modding-the-silver-case-ps4-part-1-dumping-reinstalling/" data-type="post" data-id="23">previous </a>post explained how to prepare a game for modding. Today, it&#8217;s about time we do the actual modding part!</p>



<p></p>



<p>The game was made with <strong>Unity</strong>. As such, its mostly comprised of .assets files, just like the PC version, with one particularity: the heaviest (and most important) assets have been compressed within a <strong>.psarc</strong> archive, a proprietary format used by Sony games since the <em>PS3 </em>era.</p>


<div class="wp-block-image">
<figure class="aligncenter size-full is-resized"><img decoding="async" src="https://sakimotor.github.io/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/EqA99JfXIAAxS2p.png" alt="" class="wp-image-45" width="686" height="373"/></figure></div>

<div class="wp-block-image">
<figure class="aligncenter size-full is-resized"><img decoding="async" src="https://sakimotor.github.io/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/EqA-SheXUAQCh0x.png" alt="" class="wp-image-46" width="688" height="433"/><figcaption class="wp-element-caption"><em>General folder layout. The &#8220;Media&#8221; folder contains some .assets files, as well as a &#8220;StreamingAssets&#8221; folder which contains the game&#8217;s videos as .MP4s</em>.</figcaption></figure></div>


<p></p>



<p>In 2020, I used a tool named <strong><a href="https://github.com/IcySon55/Kuriimu/releases" data-type="URL" data-id="https://github.com/IcySon55/Kuriimu/releases">Karameru</a> </strong>to extract the .<em>psarc</em> archives. This time I used <a href="http://richwhitehouse.com/index.php?content=inc_projects.php&amp;showproject=91"><strong>Noesis</strong></a>, a tool widely-used to preview 3D models from different formats, but also for extracting some types of archives, which <em>.psarc</em> is part of.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><img decoding="async" width="1428" height="632" src="https://sakimotor.github.io/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/Noesis64_yrB110L5Mw.png" alt="" class="wp-image-48"/><figcaption class="wp-element-caption"><em>Right-clicking on the archive and selecting &#8220;Export&#8221; allows us to extract it wherever we want.</em></figcaption></figure>



<p></p>



<p>Once the archive is extracted, we can treat its contents like a usual <em>Unity </em>game folder. Unfortunately, this means more extracting and repacking but it won&#8217;t be a problem, as this time we have the whole Unity modding community behind our back!</p>



<p> My favorite tool for extracting <em>Unity .assets</em> files is <a href="https://github.com/Perfare/AssetStudio" data-type="URL" data-id="https://github.com/Perfare/AssetStudio"><strong>AssetStudio</strong></a>, a software that has been faithful to me since 2019, when I first used it on the <em>PC </em>version of the game. It&#8217;s very easy of use for previewing and extracting the contents within the archives, but it unfortunately does not support reimporting/repacking.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><img decoding="async" width="1920" height="1040" src="https://sakimotor.github.io/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/image.png" alt="" class="wp-image-51"/><figcaption class="wp-element-caption"><em>When we use the &#8220;Load folder&#8221; option on our extracted archive, we can see all the TextAsset (JSON messages) and Texture2D (image textures) we need to replace. We can extract them by using the &#8220;Export&#8221; option</em>.</figcaption></figure>



<p></p>



<p>Once the files we want are extracted, we can edit them to our leisure. I won&#8217;t elaborate much on this part, but one thing I can say is that <em>AssetStudio </em>does its best to convert the assets into commonly-used formats: <em>.txt/.json</em> files for the <em>TextAsset </em>files, <em>.png</em> files for the <em>Texture2D</em> ones,  <em>.wav </em>for the <em>AudioClip</em>&#8230; Surely, we won&#8217;t have much research works to find software able to work with these file formats!</p>



<p>Anyway, after editing the extracted filed to our will, we will reimport them with a russian tool called <strong><a href="https://www.dropbox.com/s/j0dyaqogc7w2gbn/UnityEX_Advanced.rar" data-type="URL" data-id="https://www.dropbox.com/s/j0dyaqogc7w2gbn/UnityEX_Advanced.rar">UnityEX</a> </strong>(<a href="https://disk.yandex.ru/d/C7Vzo44UDXiq-w" data-type="URL" data-id="https://disk.yandex.ru/d/C7Vzo44UDXiq-w">YandexDisk</a> mirror). Just like <em>AssetStudio</em>, it&#8217;s a tool I got familiar with in 2019, when I worked with the <em>PC </em>version. It has been helpful enough for me to donate to its developer in order to get all the features of the program, such as the <em>Unity </em>2020-2021 support (more on that on the official forum <a href="https://forum.zoneofgames.ru/topic/36240-unityex/" data-type="URL" data-id="https://forum.zoneofgames.ru/topic/36240-unityex/">thread</a>), but we can work with the freeware version as well, since the game has been compiled with <em>Unity</em>&#8216;s 2016-2017 SDK!</p>


<div class="wp-block-image">
<figure class="aligncenter size-full"><img decoding="async" width="883" height="761" src="https://sakimotor.github.io/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/image-2.png" alt="" class="wp-image-53"/><figcaption class="wp-element-caption"><em>UnityEX in action on the game&#8217;s &#8220;resources.assets&#8221; archive.</em></figcaption></figure></div>


<p>Unlike <em>AssetStudio</em>, <em>UnityEX</em> only opens one file at a time, which doesn&#8217;t matter since all the content we need is stored within the <em>resources.assets</em> file. When we open an archive within UnityEX, we can extract the files by right-clicking them, then by pressing &#8220;Extract with convert or Raw&#8221;: this will convert a file to a more common extension if it&#8217;s known (like <em>AssetStudio</em> does), or leave it as-is. </p>


<div class="wp-block-image">
<figure class="aligncenter size-full is-resized"><img decoding="async" src="https://sakimotor.github.io/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/image-1.png" alt="" class="wp-image-52" width="665" height="695"/><figcaption class="wp-element-caption"><em>The extracted files go to a new folder named &#8220;<em>Unity_Assets_Files</em>&#8220;, which will contain another folder bearing the same name as our <em>.assets</em> file, in this case <em>resources</em>.</em></figcaption></figure></div>


<p>By hitting the &#8220;<em>Import all files&#8221;</em> button in <em>UnityEX</em>, the program will look all the files from the folder mentioned above, compare the filenames to the ones within the opened <em>.assets </em>archive, then replace each matching occurence. Any <em>.png</em> file is automatically converted into a <em>.tex Texture2D</em> file, then reinserted in the archive. If the program finds a filename that doesn&#8217;t correspond to anything in the archive, it will give a warning and askip if we want to continue anyway. </p>

<p>Now that the <em>resources.assets</em> has been edited, it&#8217;s time to do the whole process&#8230; Backwards! First, we need to  repack the folder containing the extracted <em>.assets</em> files back to a .psarc file. This time, instead of <em>Karameru</em>,  I used <a href="https://www.ghisler.com/">Total Commander</a>, a freeware file manager which had the benefit of supporting <em>.psarc </em>repacking thanks to a third-party <a href="http://totalcmd.net/plugring/PSARC.html">plugin</a> by <em>BEKETATA</em>.</p>

<p></p>



<p>And&#8230; that&#8217;s it! Now, we have our modded <em>archive.psarc</em> file, ready to get inserted back into the game. As there are multiple ways of doing that, which both take a fair amount of time and dedication, I will document them in a final post, one that will get more focused on the <em>PS4</em>-side manipulation than the <em>PC</em> one.</p>

					<description><![CDATA[This post will explain how to jailbreak a PS4, dumping the games and reinstall them as "Fake" PKGs.]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>As some of you might know, a few years ago I, along with my homies <a href="https://twitter.com/sytarie" data-type="URL" data-id="https://twitter.com/sytarie">Sytarie</a> and <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@RapaOST" data-type="URL" data-id="https://www.youtube.com/@RapaOST">Rapa</a>, made a french <a href="http://projectsilver.free.fr/" data-type="URL" data-id="http://projectsilver.free.fr/">translation</a> for <em>The Silver Case</em> on Steam. It wasn&#8217;t perfect in any way but I still cherish the project to this day! As I was able to acquire a copy of the <em>Silver2425</em> compilation for my PS4 a few years ago, I decided that porting our patch to as many versions as we can would be a good thing. My first (unfruitful) attempt at this was done two years ago, it is documented in the following Twitter <a href="https://twitter.com/SakiMeguro/status/1342140829696225281">thread</a>. </p>



<p>In this post, I will go through the steps we must follow in order to play a modded game on a PS4:</p>



<ul>
<li>First of all, we need a <em>FAT32 (or exFAT)</em>-formatted <strong>USB Drive</strong>. 8GB should be enough for The Silver Case but the bigger, the better!</li>
</ul>


<div class="wp-block-image">
<figure class="aligncenter size-full is-resized"><img decoding="async" src="https://sakimotor.github.io/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/explorer_sU3eH9zOzY.png" alt="" class="wp-image-28" width="509" height="521"/><figcaption class="wp-element-caption"><em>My FAT32-formatted USB Drive (also used as an emergency GParted  distro)</em></figcaption></figure></div>


<ul>
<li>As of the console, we need a <strong>jailbreakable</strong> <em>PS4</em>. Firmwares <strong>5.05, <strong>6.72, 7.02, 7.50~7.55</strong> and <strong>9.00</strong></strong>  are <a href="https://wololo.net/ps4-jailbreak-ps4-cfw4dummies/" data-type="URL" data-id="https://wololo.net/ps4-jailbreak-ps4-cfw4dummies/">compatible</a>. If you&#8217;re on a lower firmware, you should <a href="https://wololo.net/2021/12/14/ps4-how-to-manually-update-to-firmware-9-00/" data-type="URL" data-id="https://wololo.net/2021/12/14/ps4-how-to-manually-update-to-firmware-9-00/">upgrade</a> to the latest exploitable version. If you&#8217;re on a higher firmware, you&#8217;re out of lock and need to wait for an exploit to be found.<mark style="background-color:rgba(0, 0, 0, 0);color:#f23434" class="has-inline-color"> <strong>DO NOT TRUST THE &#8220;DOWNGRADER&#8221; SOFTWARES, IT&#8217;S A SCAM!</strong></mark></li>
</ul>



<ul>
<li>If the console is compatible, we will need to run a <strong>HEN</strong> exploit on boot in order to enable the jailbreak functionnalities. This is done by running <em>webkit</em> exploits either from a local server (<a href="https://github.com/Al-Azif/ps4-exploit-host" data-type="URL" data-id="https://github.com/Al-Azif/ps4-exploit-host">self-hosted</a> <a href="https://github.com/GoldHEN/GoldHEN">exploits</a>), or from a website that hosts them (example <a href="http://karo218.ir/" data-type="URL" data-id="http://karo218.ir/">here</a>). The most well-known HEN enablers are <strong>GoldHEN</strong> and <strong>MIRA</strong>, both give access to the functionnalities we need.</li>
</ul>

<ul>
<li>Once the HEN exploit is active, we need to <strong>dump the original</strong> <strong>copy </strong>of the game, and it&#8217;s <strong>updates</strong> when needed. In order to do that,  <em>BinLoader </em>must be enabled by going in the console&#8217;s Settings > Debug Settings > Servers Setting, and then ticking the checkbox here. Once enabled, we can run a <em>Game Dumping</em> exploit  (the <strong><em>Karo </em></strong>menu linked earlier has it in the <em>Dumper Group</em> category). The next booted game will be dumped to the USB Drive plugged in the console. This process might take a while, maybe a bit less than an hour, but in the end we obtain a clean folder with all of the game&#8217;s files. This step is necessary as all the PS4 games are encrypted within PKG files locked by a passcode, and are only decrypted on runtime.</li>
</ul>

<ul>
<li>At the end of the process, we have a <em>CUSAXXXXX-app</em> folder on your USB Drive. If the game has updates, we will end up with <em>CUSAXXXXX-patch</em> folders as well.</li>
</ul>


<div class="wp-block-image">
<figure class="aligncenter size-full"><img decoding="async" width="613" height="89" src="https://sakimotor.github.io/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/explorer_vTdEcReyak.png" alt="" class="wp-image-30"/><figcaption class="wp-element-caption"><em>My goodness gracious</em></figcaption></figure></div>


<ul>
<li>The next step is rebuilding the dumped games (and updates) into <strong>Fake PKGs</strong> by using the <a href="https://github.com/CyB1K/PS4-Fake-PKG-Tools-3.87" data-type="URL" data-id="https://github.com/CyB1K/PS4-Fake-PKG-Tools-3.87">Fake PKG Tools</a>: we generate a .<em>gp4 </em>file for the base game with <em>gengp4_app.exe</em>, then we open the resulting <em>.gp4</em> file within <em>orbis-pub-gen.exe</em> and click on the &#8220;Build&#8221; button on the top right corner. We then repeat the process for all the updates by running <em>gengp4_patch.exe</em> instead.</li>
</ul>


<div class="wp-block-image">
<figure class="aligncenter size-full"><img decoding="async" width="864" height="557" src="https://sakimotor.github.io/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/orbis-pub-gen_kfN9aOooql.png" alt="" class="wp-image-31"/><figcaption class="wp-element-caption"><em>Really easy to miss, but the Build button is right in front of you!</em></figcaption></figure></div>


<ul>
<li>We can then install the generated <em>PKG</em> files back on the PS4 by putting them on your USB Drive, then going into &#8220;Settings &gt; Debug Settings &gt; Package Installer&#8221;.</li>
</ul>


<div class="wp-block-image">
<figure class="aligncenter size-large is-resized"><img decoding="async" src="http://www.minihere.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/ps4-package-installer.png" alt="" width="-321" height="-180"/><figcaption class="wp-element-caption"><em>Image randomly taken from Google, too lazy to screenshot my own console</em></figcaption></figure></div>


<p>We are good to go! Now that our game has the default passcode <em>0000000000000000&#8230;0</em>, we can finally install whatever modded files we want over it.</p>
